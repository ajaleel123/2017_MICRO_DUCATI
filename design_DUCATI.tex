Placement and DRAM-TLBs can both be combined. However, the performance
contributions from each mechanism depends on the DRAM-TLB coverage. If
the DRAM-TLB fully covers the application memory footprint, then Page
Table Placement has minimal performance contribution. However, if the
application memory footprint exceeds the DRAM-TLB coverage or when the
application suffers from frequent compulsory misses, there is
opportunity from combining our two proposals. In our studies, DRAM-TLB
provides full TLB coverage with less than 0.2\% compulsory misses. As
such, DRAM-TLBs provide the bulk of the performance improvements.
