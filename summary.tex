\section{Summary}

\noindent Increasing application memory footprints and growing on-die
thread-level parallelism has made TLB performance an important
performance bottleneck in today's systems. Even page walk caching
mechanisms are unable to accommodate emerging application working-set
sizes. As a result, Last-Level TLB (LLT) coverage can be very
important to overall application performance. On the other hand LLT
misses suffer long latency due to multiple memory accesses to the page
table. As such, when LLT misses occur, reducing address translation
latency is necessary to maintain high performance.

This paper proposes low-cost hardware mechanisms to accelerate virtual
to physical address translation by improving on-die {\em LLT coverage}
and {\em LLT miss penalty}. We improve on-die TLB coverage by
proposing {\em Unified Cache and TLB (UCAT)}, which enables the
conventional unified Last-Level Cache (LLC) to also hold TLB entries.
UCAT increases on-die LLT coverage by allowing as many TLB entries as
there are cache lines in the conventional on-chip LLC. We show that
UCAT improves performance by 60\% (up to 4x) on average across a set
of memory intensive GPU workloads. We show that these improvements can
be realized with negligible changes to the existing LLC architecture.

% This is because it still requires multiple requests to the page table
% for retrieving the address translation.

While UCAT improves performance significantly, it does not decrease
the number of page table accesses on an LLT miss. To address this
problem, we propose {\em DRAM-TLB}. DRAM-TLB serves as the next larger
level in the TLB hierarchy architected in DRAM technology and can be
arbitrarily sized to provide the desired TLB coverage. In steady
state, DRAM-TLB can avoid multiple page table accesses and provides
address translation using a single memory access. Consequently,
DRAM-TLB is a low latency alternative to walking the page table on an
LLT miss. Our studies show that DRAM-TLB architected using stacked
memory technology improves performance by 22\% on average (up to
2.25X). We show that DRAM-TLB requires less than 1\% the capacity of
our baseline 16GB stacked memory system.

Finally, we propose {\em DUCATI}, an address translation architecture
that combines the benefits of DRAM-TLBs and UCAT while requiring
negligible hardware overhead. DUCATI improves performance by 81\% (up
to 4.5x) for 4KB pages and by 56\% and 8\% when applied to 64KB and
2MB page systems respectively.
